# Project Breakdown

Development Phases

Phase 1: Prototype & MVP (Months 1-3): Focus on building a working prototype of the core agent loop. In this phase, we implement the basic plan-execute cycle with a single model (e.g. GPT-4 via API) and a controlled environment. Key tasks include connecting the LLM to a Python-based execution manager, enabling it to run simple Ubuntu terminal commands, and integrating a minimal browser automation (perhaps using Browser-use/Playwright in a basic way). The goal by end of Phase 1 is an MVP that can take a simple multi-step instruction (like “create a file, search the web for X, and put the info into the file”) and successfully complete it. We’ll also build a rudimentary web interface for internal testing, showing the agent’s thought process and actions. MVP features are limited (no complex error handling yet, a small set of allowed commands, maybe only one browser tab support), but prove end-to-end viability.

Phase 2: Core Expansion & Alpha Launch (Months 4-6): Here we expand the agent’s capabilities and robustness. We add dynamic re-planning – allowing the agent to adjust its plan based on results. The self-verification loop is introduced (initially perhaps as a simple “reflect after task” prompt). We also broaden the toolset available in the Ubuntu VM (installing more CLI tools or possibly giving the agent a code execution ability within the VM). Security measures like command whitelisting and basic sandbox tests are put in place. By the end of Phase 2, we aim to have an alpha version that can handle moderately complex tasks reliably. We’ll test it on diverse scenarios (e.g. fetching data, doing simple analysis, using the browser for different sites). This phase also includes setting up the cloud infrastructure for deployment – containerizing the agent and being able to spin up the environment on demand. Small-group testing might begin here with friendly users.

Phase 3: Beta Release (Months 7-9): In this phase, we polish the user experience and scalability. A user-facing web app is developed with a dashboard for running agents, viewing logs, and providing input. We implement the subscription and authentication system (so users can sign up, manage API keys if needed, etc.). The agent’s reliability is improved by incorporating more verification steps and handling edge cases (for example, if a web page requires login or a terminal command fails, ensure the agent responds gracefully rather than getting stuck). We also integrate support for both OpenAI and Anthropic APIs, possibly allowing a user to choose which model to use (or do it behind the scenes based on availability/cost). During Phase 3 we conduct a closed beta with a larger audience to get feedback on real-world usage. The system’s scalability will be tested (simulate many concurrent users) and any bottlenecks in the architecture addressed. By the end of this phase, we expect to have a public beta launch – the product is usable by early customers with the core feature set solid.

Phase 4: Production & Growth (Months 10-12 and beyond): After beta, we iterate towards a production-ready V1 release. This involves hardening security (full security audit, refine permission system), implementing billing and payment systems for subscriptions or usage fees, and setting up customer support processes. We also build any remaining features needed for our go-to-market – for instance, an onboarding tutorial for new users, or an admin panel to monitor system health. With user feedback from beta, we’ll prioritize improvements: maybe the need for more memory (longer context handling), additional connectors (like direct integration to Gmail or other services via APIs to avoid only using the browser), and fine-tuning the prompts for better task performance. Once we are confident in stability, we officially launch V1 for the general public. Post-launch, this phase segues into continuous development: releasing updates, adding features, and scaling the system based on demand. We will also start working on enterprise-specific features (such as on-prem deployment option or AD/SSO integration) as we begin engaging with enterprise clients after the public launch.

MVP Features

For the Minimum Viable Product (delivered by Phase 1), we will include the following key features to demonstrate the concept:
- Natural Language Task Input: Users can input a goal or task in everyday language (e.g. “Find the weather forecast for this week and save it to a text file”). The agent will parse this and start planning.
- Basic Planning & Single-step Execution: The agent can break a simple goal into a sequence of steps and execute them one by one. The initial planning might be minimal (possibly the user has to give a bit more structured input), but the agent will at least execute multiple commands in sequence autonomously.
- Ubuntu Terminal Access: The agent can run a set of whitelisted terminal commands in the Ubuntu VM. For MVP, this may include file operations (touch, echo, cat to create and write files), basic network calls (curl or a Python script to fetch a URL), and maybe launching a simple program. The output of commands is captured and fed back into the agent’s decision process.
- Browser Access (Limited): Using an automation library, the MVP agent can perform a web search and retrieve page content. We might integrate a simple headless browser action like searching Google and getting top results text, or opening a specific URL and extracting the text. This demonstrates the crucial capability of switching from terminal to browser. It may be limited to read-only interactions at first (not filling forms yet in MVP).
- Logging and Plan Display: The system provides a log of what the agent is doing for transparency. In the MVP interface (even if just a command-line or simple web page), a user can see the agent’s proposed plan steps and the outcome of each step. This helps in debugging and builds trust that the agent is following the instructions.
- Basic Error Handling: If a step fails (command not found, or site not reachable), the agent doesn’t crash completely. MVP will likely just report the failure and stop, or try a very simplistic fallback, but it will show that it can at least recognize a failure. Full dynamic re-planning might be too advanced for MVP, but some awareness is there.
- No-Code Setup: From a user perspective (especially if we allow some external testers), using the MVP doesn’t require coding. They interact with it via the provided interface. All configuration (connecting to the LLM via API keys, setting up the VM) is handled behind the scenes.

These MVP features are deliberately the core essentials to validate that the autonomous loop works. With this MVP, we should be able to achieve a basic end-to-end demo: for example, user says “What’s the latest price of Bitcoin? Save it in a file”, and the agent will perhaps run curl to an API or use the browser to find the price, then create a text file in the VM with the info. Once this is proven possible, subsequent versions can expand on this foundation.

Future Scalability and Improvements

After the initial release, there are many opportunities to enhance the system both in capability and performance:
- Advanced Learning and Adaptation: Currently, the agent plans per session based only on the immediate context. In the future, we can give the agent a long-term memory or learning ability. For instance, it could remember how it solved past tasks and apply that knowledge to new tasks (forming a knowledge base of successful strategies). We could also allow it to learn user preferences over time (e.g. if a user always prefers data in a CSV vs. Excel, the agent learns to choose CSV). This could be done by storing past task logs and outcomes and using them to fine-tune the planning model or by building a retrieval system that the agent consults.
- Plugin Ecosystem: We envision releasing APIs or a plugin system for third-party developers to extend the agent with new tools. For example, a developer could add a plugin that lets the agent interface with email (so it can read/send emails on behalf of the user), or a calendar plugin to create appointments, or integrate with IoT devices. This would turn the agent into a platform that can do almost anything with the right plugin. An open plugin ecosystem (with proper security sandboxing) can greatly accelerate the agent’s usefulness and adoption, similar to how browser extensions expanded browser capabilities.
- Multi-Modal Capabilities: Currently, the agent deals with text (and maybe some structured data). In future, we can integrate image and audio processing. For example, the agent could use an OCR tool to read text from images/PDFs in the VM, or utilize a text-to-speech and speech-to-text for voice interactions. A user might eventually speak a request to the agent or ask it to analyze an image (“describe what’s in this diagram and write a summary”). Using APIs like OCR engines or even vision-capable models (like GPT-4’s vision or open-source computer vision models) would unlock these scenarios.
- Enhanced UI and User Experience: As we gather feedback, we’ll continually improve the interface. We might add a visual flow view of the plan (so users can see a flowchart of what the agent will do), an editing capability for the user to intervene (maybe the user can modify the plan steps before execution or during pauses), and better real-time visualization (like showing the actual browser screen if needed or graphical outputs if the agent generates a chart, etc.). For general users, we want to make interaction as intuitive as possible – maybe a chat-like interface where the agent occasionally asks clarifying questions and the user can respond, making it a conversation rather than just one-shot instructions.
- Optimization and Cost Reduction: On the back-end, we will work on optimizing the system to reduce latency and cost. This could involve fine-tuning smaller models to take over parts of tasks (so we don’t call GPT-4 for everything), optimizing the prompt engineering to get accurate results faster, and possibly developing our own proprietary models specialized in agent planning (to reduce dependency on expensive third-party APIs). Also, as hardware evolves, we can leverage GPU acceleration or specialized AI hardware in the cloud to speed up model inference for real-time performance.
- Enterprise Features: Future improvements will also include features needed for large organizations: audit logs of agent actions (so an admin can see what the agent did for compliance), role-based access control if multiple people in a team use shared agents, integration with single sign-on systems, and deployment options where an enterprise can run the whole stack in their cloud (for data-sensitive scenarios). We can also allow connecting the agent to proprietary data sources securely – for instance, an enterprise might plug it into their internal knowledge base so the agent can use private company data when executing tasks (with proper access control).
- Globalization and Localization: To reach broader audiences, we will work on supporting multiple languages. The LLMs we use are capable of understanding many languages, so we can allow users to give instructions in their native language and have the agent respond accordingly. The interface text and documentation would be translated as well. This could open up markets in non-English-speaking regions which have significant user bases interested in AI tools.

The roadmap above is iterative – at each stage, we’ll prioritize improvements that deliver the most user value and address any pain points observed. The autonomous agent technology is rapidly evolving, so our plan is to remain agile and incorporate the latest advancements (for example, if new model releases or research give better methods for agent alignment, we will adopt those). By continually improving, we aim to maintain a leadership position in the market, ensuring the agent becomes smarter, faster, and more useful over time.
